- Consider a Cricket Tournament “ABC CUP” organized by an organization. 
- In the tournament there are many teams are contesting each having a Teamid, Team_Name, City, a coach. Each team is uniquely identified by using Teamid.
- A team can have many Players and a captain. Each player is uniquely identified by Playerid, having a Name, and multiple phone numbers, age. 
- A player represents only one team. There are many Stadiums to conduct matches. Each stadium is
identified using Stadium_id, having a stadium_name, Address (involves city, area_name, pincode).
- A team can play many matches. Each match played between the two teams in the scheduled date and time in the predefined Stadium. Each match is identified uniquely by using Match_id. Eachmatch won by any of the one team that also wants to record in the database.
